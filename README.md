This is our 1st group project of Operating System, in which we have made Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator
In this project, we have develop a simulator for CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling) with real-time visualizations. The simulator should allow users to input processes with arrival times, burst times, and priorities and visualize Gantt charts and performance metrics like average waiting time and turnaround time.
